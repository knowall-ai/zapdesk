|===
|Problem |Solution

|**"Sign in failed" after Microsoft login**
|Verify Azure AD redirect URI matches exactly: `https://devdesk.knowall.ai/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`. Check AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID and AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET are correct.

|**"Unauthorized" when viewing tickets**
|Session may have expired. Sign out and sign in again. Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set correctly and matches across deployments.

|**No tickets showing in list**
|Ensure work items have the "ticket" tag in Azure DevOps. Verify user has permission to access the Azure DevOps project. Check browser console for API errors.

|**"Failed to fetch tickets" error**
|Azure DevOps API may be down. Check https://status.dev.azure.com/. Verify AZURE_DEVOPS_ORG is set correctly. Check user has valid Azure DevOps license.

|**Comments not saving**
|User may not have write permission in Azure DevOps. Check the work item is not locked. Verify session hasn't expired.

|**Email webhook not creating tickets**
|Verify EMAIL_WEBHOOK_SECRET header matches. Check sender domain has project mapping. Review server logs for error details.

|**Blank page after login**
|Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Verify all environment variables are set. Clear browser cache and cookies.

|**"Invalid configuration" on login page**
|AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID or AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID is missing or invalid. Check .env file and Azure App Service configuration.

|**Slow ticket loading**
|Large number of tickets may cause delays. Consider pagination. Check Azure DevOps API rate limits.

|**CSS/styles not loading**
|Clear browser cache. Run `npm run build` to regenerate styles. Check Tailwind configuration.

|**"Token expired" errors**
|Refresh token may have expired. Sign out and sign in again. Check token lifetimes in Azure AD app settings.

|**Can't see specific project's tickets**
|User lacks permission to that Azure DevOps project. Add user to project in Azure DevOps. Check project exists in organization.

|**Search not returning expected results**
|Search only covers client-side loaded tickets. Use Azure DevOps for advanced queries. Check filter settings.

|**Avatar images not loading**
|Azure DevOps image URLs may require authentication. This is expected behavior - initials shown instead.

|**"CORS error" in browser**
|API routes should proxy all requests. Check you're using /api/ routes, not calling DevOps directly. Verify NEXTAUTH_URL is correct.

|**Deployment failing**
|Check GitHub Actions logs. Verify AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE secret is current. Ensure Node.js version matches (18+).

|**Custom domain not working**
|Verify DNS CNAME record. Check Azure SSL certificate status. Allow up to 24 hours for DNS propagation.

----

=== Check Browser Console

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Check Network tab for failed requests

=== Verify Environment Variables

[source,bash]
----
# Local development
cat .env

# Azure App Service
az webapp config appsettings list --name devdesk-knowall --resource-group devdesk-rg
----

=== Test Azure DevOps Connection

[source,bash]
